# Greenhouse Energy Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning

- train.py (Aron) : contains the reinforcement learning agent controlling the heating and ventilation of the greenhouse
- environment.py (Jokubas): thermodynamic simulation of a greenhouse used to train the RL agent
- reward.py (Tom): contains the reward mechanism to train the agent based on user-defined values and simulated sensor data from the environment simulation
- GUI (Adam): 
- database (Yuelian):
- options.py (Aron) : contains all the hyperparameters
- plot.py (Jokubas) :
