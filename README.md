# KV6002_RL-BEMS

train.py : contains the reinforcement learning agent controlling the heating and ventilation of the greenhouse
environment.py : thermodynamic simulation of a greenhouse used to train the RL agent
reward.py : contains the reward mechanism to train the agent based on user-defined values and simulated sensor data from the environment simulation
GUI : 
database :

So the whole thing will launch from the GUI amiright
